Weekly deaths statistics lookup tool. All data is obtained via the ONS (Office for National Statistics) API, and calculations are run to obtain total number of deaths, as well as mortality rates for all administrative areas of England and Wales. Postcode lookups achieved via Postcodes.io.

Initially developed for an end of degree project - module TM470 - for a BSc Hons in Computing and IT with The Open University.

Other details:

• developed using React Native; in the Expo managed workflow environment

• requires no device permissions

• stores no data - be it on a user's device, or in a database

• includes internet connection status listeners for error handling

• uses and combines two APIs - the ONS API and the postcodes.io API

• contains all-original artwork (including a GIF) - designed by myself

This is an entirely solo project.

The ONS has discontinued the weekly datasets as of 2024.

NB: This app is not affiliated with the ONS. It is only using freely available data (via the freely available API). Any and all interpretations of this data are limited to the scope of this app.
